A simple 4-channel step-down converter I am using for my telescope to supply power to multiple devices at different voltages from a 19.5V powersupply
It also has space for the components for a DIY electronic focuser(WeMos ESP32-S2 Mini, EasyDrive)

It uses 4 of these step-down converter which should be able to output about 1A.
